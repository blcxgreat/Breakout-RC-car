# Breakout-RC-car
Final project for embedded system design

Coded by Chunguang(Eric) Xie and Shangrong Li

This the final project for embedded system design, using TIVA tm4c123 micro-controller, with two motor drivers, four motors,
Bluetooth, LCD touchable screen and external charger as power supply. The system is coded fully in RTOS.

The player would not be able to control the RC car until they finish a 'Breakout' game. The game has a random "trophy". If the player
got the trophy, he/she could touch the screen to choose between "car operating" or "continue game". If car operating is chosen,
the player could use his/her smart phone to control the RC car using Bluetooth. If continue game is chosen, the player 
could continue to play the Breakout game.
